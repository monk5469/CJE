We used three diseases to verify the CJE algorithm, namely: 1.schizophrenia (SCZ). The Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Schizophrenia Imaging Database:  http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html; 2.mild cognitive impairment (MCI), download from: The Alzheimer 's diseases, Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database: https://adni.loni.usc.edu/; 3. autism spectrum disorder (ASD), download from: The Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Schizophrenia Imaging Database:  http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html.
When you need to run the program, copy the ROI_data file for the corresponding disease into the package you want to run. Please refer to the SCZ file for detailed code comments.
